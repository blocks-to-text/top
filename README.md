## [The Transition](https://github.com/blocks-to-text/the-transition)

Transitioning from beginner programming environments (Scratch, Logo, Blockly, ...) to more "authentic" programming is not really about the blocks.  The most important change students need to master is going from programming animations to programming the computer directly.  

Learning environments like Scratch or Logo show students their code and the final animated result, but leave a black box when it comes to how the coded instructions are interpreted and how the programs manage state over time.

Guiding your students to programming the machine directly is a process of removing analogies and black boxes, replacing them with level-appropriate (but correct) understandings of how computers and programming languages work.  Whether students write their code with letters or blocks is not actually important.

## [Isolating the Notional Machine](https://github.com/blocks-to-text/isolating-the-notional-machine)

this trasition doesn't mean a jump straight to compilers, memory systems, and language design.

Often what looks like difficulty with problem solving or computational reasoning is really misconceptions on how the computer executes code.

## [Easing into Text](https://github.com/blocks-to-text/easing-into-text)

It's easy to overlook that coding with text requires a high level of literacy, programming is one of the most exacting forms of writing.  Students not only need to spell words exactly right, but also need to format perfectly and are expected to use a wide variety of characters that never appear in every-day life.  

Working with existing code is also an extreme form of reading.  Students need to understand what the code is _supposed to_ do according to the programmer's intentions, figure out what the interpreter will _actually_ do, and modify the text to have new behavior without interfering with what already exists.  This requires a level of pattern recognition and attention to detail in spelling & format that is simply not expected elsewhere.

Focusing on typing skills, using word processors in other classes, studying code as a text without executing it, and playing off-line games that involve reading and writing pseudo-code can go a long way towards preparing students to write code from scratch.
